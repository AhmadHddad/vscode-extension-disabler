## **vscode-extension-disabler**

**Description:**

A handy extension for those who work on different projects on VsCode, some extensions are not used and sometimes can be no ideal to be enabled on other projects, so instead of going around the currently installed extensions and disabling those which are not in use, you can simply use this extension to easily select extensions to be disabled, also will be saved as a profile in settings.json file, so it is easier to auto-disable same extensions on similar other projects.
