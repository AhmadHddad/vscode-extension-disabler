## **vscode-extension-disabler**

  

**Description:**

  

A handy extension for those who work on different projects on Vscode, some extensions are not used and sometimes can be no ideal to be enabled on other projects, so instead of going around the currently installed extensions and disabling those which are not in use, you can simply use this extension to easily select extensions to be disabled, also will be saved as a profile in settings.json file, so it is easier to auto-disable same extensions on similar other projects.

 **Note***
 The extension does not effect permanently disabled extensions. 

## HOW TO USE

## -Version 0.1.0

 * Added a new feature the ability to **Edit** extensions profile, **Adding** or **Deleting** extensions from profile and applying that change to a workspace.
  * **Filtering** built-in VSCode extensions.
  * Using extensions title as its label instead of id.
  * Fixed some bugs.


In Settings.json file under `extensionDisabler.profiles` you can see all available profiles,

also `extension disabled.storage` you can see all extensions that are disabled with profile name as a key.

**so when you sync your settings throw devices you can still sync your profiles and use this extension to disable the same extensions in other projects**

  

## Credits

  

This is the first time I develop an extension, so a huge credit for:

  

- VS Code team's [in depth guide to extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension?wt.mc_id=profileswitcher-github-aapowell).

- Profile Switcher extension, from Arron Powell, that helped me with some source code [vscode-profile-switcher](https://github.com/aaronpowell/vscode-profile-switcher).

- Many videos and tutorials on YouTube ðŸ˜€!.

- Stack overflow community.
